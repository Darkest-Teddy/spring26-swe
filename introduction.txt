I'm Jack He, a freshman studying Computer Science and possibly minoring in Data Science @ BU! 

Even though I'm early in my college career, I have been involved in many projects, events, and some cool internships. So far, I have done two hackathons, Boston Hacks and BU's Data Science + X. These are also the two hackathons I have won.

My favorite classes in BU so far have to be DS219 for its lay-back work, WR152 for its video game writing topic, CS210 for its challenging but rewarding coursework in hardware, and CS132 for its pure math which I missed from high school.
